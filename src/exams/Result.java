The task is to extract a subsequence of exactly k characters from the url that minimizes the URL compression, defined as the difference between the length of the subsequence and the number of distinct characters in the subsequence.
Implement a function to compute the minimum possible compression for any subsequence of length k.
The function minimizeURLCompression takes the following inputs:
string url: a string representing the original URL code int k: the desired length of the subsequence
The function should return the minimum possible compression in any subsequence of length k.
Note: The subsequence of a string is a string obtained by deleting any set of characters from the original string while retaining the order of remaining characters.
Example
url = "ooxoxo"
k= 4
One optimal subsequence of length exactly k is "ooxx". The
